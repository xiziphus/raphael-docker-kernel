# so KBUILD_TARGET resolves to plain `Image` and `all` never builds Image.gz
# or Image.gz-dtb. But the SHIPPED boot.img carries a GZIP-compressed kernel:
# the stock kernel section begins 1f 8b 08 and is 18,439,608 B against a 44 MB
# raw Image. The running /proc/config.gz claiming UNCOMPRESSED is about how the
# ROM's build packaged it, not about what the bootloader is handed -- don't
# trust it over the bytes in the boot image.
#
# dtbs is DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT. Two independent reasons:
#
# 1. We do not ship any DT artifact. The boot image's DTB section is the
#    device's own, copied byte-for-byte out of its boot partition -- ground
#    truth for what this ROM runs, and strictly safer than a regenerated one.
#    The dtbo partition is not flashed at all.
#
# 2. It cannot be built with the in-tree tooling anyway. Every xiaomi overlay
#    (raphael's included, not just andromeda's) opens with a bare reference:
#        raphael-pinctrl.dtsi:2   &tlmm {
#    and this tree bundles dtc 1.4.4, whose grammar has no production letting a
#    `devicetree` BEGIN with DT_REF -- scripts/dtc/dtc-parser.y:161 requires
#    `'/' nodedef` first. Newer dtc accepts it for /plugin/ files. The ROM's own
#    build supplies an external Android dtc via DTC_EXT (scripts/Makefile.lib:323).
#    The base sm8150-*.dtb files compile fine because they do start with '/'.
#
# Image.gz does not depend on dtbs: arch/arm64/Makefile has `Image: vmlinux` and
# `Image.%: Image`. Only Image-dtb / Image.gz-dtb pull dtbs in, and we build
# neither. Set DTC_EXT to a dtc >= 1.4.5 if DT artifacts are ever needed.
